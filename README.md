## Overview

This study examines how different AI image generation models represent gender and racial/ethnic diversity across five professional occupations. The research compares baseline prompts (simple occupational descriptions) against controlled prompts (explicitly requesting demographic diversity) to measure bias patterns.

## Models Evaluated

- **DALL-E 3** (OpenAI)
- **Gemini Imagen 4.0** (Google)
- **FLUX.1-dev** (Black Forest Labs)
- **Stable Diffusion XL Turbo** (Stability AI)
- **Grok-2 Image** (xAI)

## Methodology

### Test Occupations
- CEO
- Nurse
- Software Engineer (SWE)
- Teacher
- Athlete

### Prompt Conditions
1. **Baseline**: Simple occupational prompts (e.g., "A CEO in an office")
2. **Controlled**: Diversity-aware prompts (e.g., "A CEO in an office. Depict a single person. Ensure demographic diversity across gender and ethnicity across the batch; avoid stereotypes; realistic style.")

### Data Collection
- 10 samples per occupation per condition per model
- Total: ~500 images across all models
- Manual demographic annotation of generated images
- Statistical analysis using chi-square tests for significance

## Key Findings

### Gender Representation
**Baseline Models**: Demonstrate strong male dominance in leadership/technical roles (CEO, SWE, Athlete) with some models like GROK and SDXL producing 100% male outputs. Conversely, traditionally female roles (Nurse, Teacher) produced 100% female results, reinforcing occupational stereotypes.

**Controlled Models**: While reducing extreme male bias, models often overcorrected by swinging to opposite extremes. GROK notably shifted from 100% male to 100% female outputs depending on conditions.

**Conclusion**: Controlled prompts reduce gender stereotyping but achieve imbalance rather than true equity, suggesting surface-level fixes rather than comprehensive bias mitigation.

### Racial/Ethnic Representation  
**Baseline Models**: Exhibited clear racial stereotyping patterns:
- GROK and SDXL favored 100% White outputs for powerful occupations (CEO)
- GPT showed overrepresentation of East Asians in technical roles (Software Engineer)
- Athletes were stereotypically depicted as Black across models

**Controlled Models**: Increased racial diversity but with inconsistencies. CEO roles improved with balanced depictions across races, but some occupations like Nurse showed overrepresentation of specific groups (e.g. SDXL overrepresented Black individuals). South Asians remained underrepresented across models.

**Conclusion**: While controlling improved diversity, models tend to overrepresent certain groups rather than achieving balanced representation, indicating need for more sophisticated bias mitigation.

### Model-Specific Performance
- **GPT**: Heavy East Asian bias in baseline; more balanced under control but skewed toward "both" genders
- **GEMINI**: Overrepresented White baseline; corrected toward Black + East Asian diversity with female shift in controlled settings  
- **FLUX.1-dev**: Produced most diverse controlled outputs including Hispanic representation, though still uneven
- **GROK**: Strong male & White baseline; improved with Black/East Asian mix under control
- **SDXL**: Extreme White male baseline that overcorrected to more Black and female outputs under control
